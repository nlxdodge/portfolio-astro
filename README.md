# 🚀 Astro Portfolio

Because Nuxt 3 is still not feature complete with, for example, the markdown, image plugin and static hosting. I decided to re-do my portfolio. But this time in the new Astro framework to dive deep and to see how quickly I can get up to speed. And needless to say, in a couple hours I am almost completly done.

## ☄ Todo
