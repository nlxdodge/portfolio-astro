# My programming and coding odyssey

Welcome to my humble site, you can find all sorts of informational posts and my proud works. While also giving a sneak peek for things I am looking into for the future.

## How it al started üê£

I Started of my career with interests in computer science at a very young age. And took that to school where I choose to be an aspiring game developer.
But soon found out that making games was almost the same as writing code for websites or other applications.
Hence, I started to learn a new and higher degree for application development.
After graduation and having done 4 internships at different work environments, I am currently employed at [Sogeti](https://www.sogeti.nl/) and though them I am working for
[ING](https://ing.nl/).

## Experience with üßëüèª‚Äçüíª

While I am learning lots of new things, here is a short list of things I am currenly working with and have experiences with:

- <LabelCollection
    name="Backend: "
    labels={["Java", "Kotlin", "Rust", "Ruby", "Python", "PHP", "C# with Unity"]}
  />
- <LabelCollection
    name="Databases: "
    labels={["Cassandra", "PostgreSQL", "MySQL"]}
  />
- <LabelCollection
    name="Cloud: "
    labels={["OpenShift", "AWS", "Azure"]}
  />  
- <LabelCollection
    name="Frontend: "
    labels={["Astro", "Vue", "Angular", "NPM",]}
  />
- <LabelCollection
    name="Tooling: "
    labels={["Docker", "Podman", "Jetbrains/Intellij", "VSCode", "DBeaver",]}
  />

_(From recetly used to last used)_

## The Future üöÄ

Things I want to look at in the future that peak my intrests include things like C/C++ and Rust. I really want to learn more lower level languages as well.
So for 2023's Advent of Code I might try out one of these languages.
