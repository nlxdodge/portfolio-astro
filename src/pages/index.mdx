# My programming and coding odyssey

Welcome to my humble site, you can find all sorts of informational posts and my proud works. While also giving a sneak peek for things I am looking into for the future.

## How it al started üê§

I Started of my career with interests in computer science at a very young age. And took that to school where I choose to be an aspiring game developer.
But soon found out that making games was almost the same as writing code for websites or other applications in general.

Hence, I started to learn a new and higher degree for application development.
After graduation and having done 4 internships at different work environments and different scales of companies, I am currently working for [Sogeti](https://www.sogeti.nl/) and though them I am working for
[ING](https://ing.nl/), one of the major Dutch banks.

## Experience with üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

While I am learning lots of new things every day, here is a short list of things I am currenly working with and have experiences with.
The best thing is to check my to see where I have worked before with more details.

(From recently used to last used, where a üî• indicates the most experience overal)

## The Future ‚è©

Things I want to look at in the future that peak my intrests include things like C/C++ together with Linux (Arch maybe), because I really want to learn more lower level languages as well.
I already have checked out Rust in the 2023's Advent of Code and I am really liking it this far.
