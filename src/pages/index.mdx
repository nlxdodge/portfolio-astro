# Backend Redefined

Welcome to my humble site, you can find all sorts of informational posts and my proud works. While also giving a sneak peek for you to try it out yourselves.

## How it al started

I Started of my career with interests in computer science at a very young age. And took that to school where I choose to be an aspiring game developer. But soon found out that making games was almost the same as writing code for websites or other applications. Hence, I started to learn a new and higher degree for application development. At which I am running my last year of right now.

With a short list of some of my experiences:

- Backend | Java, Kotlin, Ruby, Pyton, PHP, C# (Unity), C# .NET
- Frontend | Vue with NPM & Yarn
- Cloud | AWS (Cloudformation, cloudfront, lambda's, gateway integration etc.)
