# Backend Redefined

Welcome to my humble site, you can find all sorts of informational posts and my proud works. While also giving a sneak peek for things I am looking into for the future.

## How it al started

I Started of my career with interests in computer science at a very young age. And took that to school where I choose to be an aspiring game developer. 
But soon found out that making games was almost the same as writing code for websites or other applications. 
Hence, I started to learn a new and higher degree for application development. 
After graduation and having done 4 internships at different work environments I am currently employed at [Sogeti](https://www.sogeti.nl/) and though them I am employed and working at 
[ING](https://ing.nl/)

## Experience

With a short list of some of my experiences in:

- **Backend**: Java, Kotlin, Ruby, Pyton, PHP, C# (Unity)
- **Databases**: Cassandra, PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **Frontend**: Astro, NPM, Yarn, Nuxt, Vue
- **Cloud**: OpenShift, AWS

*(From recetly used to last used)*

## Future

Things I want to look at in the future that peak my intrests include things like C/C++ and Rust. I really want to learn more lower level languages as well. 
So for 2023's Advent of Code I might try out one of these languages.
