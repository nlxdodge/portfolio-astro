## Contents

Every time when I do a Windows installation (because my current one is broken or I want to have a clean slate again) I need to install a bunch of programs again.
Normally this would take a really long time and I sometimes forget what software I have used, because some software I almost never use.

Well Winget comes to the rescue. And yes I know Scoop and Chocolatey are also a thing these days, and lately even more package managers that keep emerging. But it gets better down below 😉

## Winget.run

You might have already seen this page before if you are a winget user (hopefully). But if not, let me introduce you to [Winget.run](https://winget.run).
This website is basically a UI search for Winget. But that is not all there are a plethora of tools available to use for Winget.
Not everyone is a CLI only fan, including me. So I like Winget.run. But after learning about Chocolatey at work (that's the only tool we can use there). I started to wonder.

__Is there not something else that can combine everything?__

## Winget UI

On of those tools is [Winget UI](https://github.com/marticliment/WingetUI). Not only does it function as a Winget Package manager.
But also for Chocolatey and Scoop on Windows. So you can search new software, update and manage all in the same tool.

## Installation if wanted via Winget

```bash
winget install -e --id SomePythonThings.WingetUIStore
```

## Why write this article about some software management?

For automation of course 👨🏻‍💻!
I created a small Gist on my Github account to automatically install things like: 

- 🎮 Game Launchers.
- 👨🏻‍💻 Development tools, like IDE's and UI's for containers.
- 🎞 Media tools, like VLC, Handbreak etc.
- 🏴‍☠️ And others tools that shall not be named here.

## What about Linux? They stole our idea!

You are technically correct, but I would like to still use Windows for my machine as I play a lot of games in my spare time.
I did buy a Steam Deck and I have been using it for a while now, seeing how well that works I am fairly certain we are moving in the right direction. 
But for most MMO's and big FPS games like Apex or Call of Duty, that still have Anti-Cheat I would rather not have a chance to get banned.
