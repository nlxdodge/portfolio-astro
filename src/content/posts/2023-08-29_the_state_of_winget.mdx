## Contents

Every time when I do a Windows installation (because my current one is broken or I want to have a clean slate again) I need to install a bunch of programs again.
Normally this would take a really long time and I sometimes forget what software I have used, because some software I almost never use.

Well Winget comes to the rescue. And yes I know Scoop and Chocolatey are also a thing these days, and lately even more package managers that keep emerging. But it gets better down below 😉

## Winget.run

You might have already seen this page before if you are a winget user (hopefully). But if not, let me introduce you to [Winget.run](https://winget.run).
This website is basically a UI search for Winget. But that is not all there are a plethora of tools available to use for Winget.
Not everyone is a CLI only fan, including me, that's why I like Winget.run. But after learning about Chocolatey at work (that's the only tool we can use there). I started to wonder, what else is available for Windows?

__Is there not something else that can combine everything?__

## Winget UI

One of those tools is [Winget UI](https://github.com/marticliment/WingetUI). Not only does it function as a Winget package manager UI, but also as a UI for Chocolatey and Scoop. So you can search new software, update and manage all in the same tool. Yes you read it correctly, all three tools combined, and even more. They also have integrations for PIP, NPM packages, Powershell and .NET Tool.

Here is a picture of the tool in action. On the Source column you can see where the package is actually being downloaded from, together with the version and the package ID.

If you want to use Winget UI yourself then you're in luck!
Installing the Winget UI tool is really simple with Winget itself, by just using:

```bash
winget install -e --id SomePythonThings.WingetUIStore
```

And you can already start using it right away. And even comes with dark mode 🌚

## Why write this article about some software management tool?

For automation of course.
I created a small Gist on my personal Github account to automatically install things like: 

- 🎮 Game Launchers.
- 👨🏻‍💻 Development tools, like IDE's and UI's for containers.
- 🎥 Media tools, like VLC, Handbreak etc.
- 🏴‍☠️ And others tools that shall not be named here.

## What about Linux? They stole our idea!

You are absolutely correct, but I would like to still use Windows for my machine as I play a lot of games in my spare time.
I did buy a Steam Deck and I have been using it for a while now, seeing how well that works I am fairly certain we are moving in the right direction. 
But for most MMO's and big FPS games like Apex or Call of Duty, that still have Anti-Cheat I would rather not have a chance to get banned.
