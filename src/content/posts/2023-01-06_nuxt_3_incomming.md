As you might have seen, I have some Vue.js experience, and I am also good on the way on learning the composition API in Vue version 3.0. Now, one of my friends mentioned what Nuxt was. It's a framework to easily write smaller applications in, while also being able to do lots more.

Like rendering your website statically and just serving that.

As I would like to transition away from PHP with my current background I wanted to try it out. But Nuxt 3 wasn't released yet when I wanted to start working on it. So I waited, and waited. And after a while the first Nuxt 3 versions came along including Nuxt Content which makes writing markdown for pages a lot easier.

But I am still waiting for the static page rendering for Nuxt Image so that I can optimize my images locally instead of doing it by hand every time.

So take a look around.
