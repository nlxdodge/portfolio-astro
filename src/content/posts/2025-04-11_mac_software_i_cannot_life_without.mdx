import Button from "../../components/Button.astro";
import FlexCenter from "../../components/FlexCenter.astro";

It all started when my coworkers made scripts that only worked for Mac. After that I had to switch. Windows was not an option anymore.

Looking back I say I like the hardware of the Mac way more then the Windows machines we used to get. Long battery life, good screen, good speakers, etc.
Nothing to complain about, except the software/usage of the tilling manager (or lack there off when I started using my new Mac). 

But working with the software has some desires and quirks that made me itchy. So I started looking for solutions on MacOS.
Quickly I found that other people on the internet are exactly in the same boat, when they switched from Windows to MacOS.

- [Alt+tab](https://github.com/lwouis/alt-tab-macos)
  - This make the Alt Tabbing the same as on Windows, there is no option to make it flip between all open windows including the same application that is open. 
    An example being Intelij. Lets say you have 5 windows open in Mac. You need to use <kbd>\`</kbd> + <kbd>Command</kbd> in order to switch between open windows of the same kind.
    That means that if you use <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> you are never going to go to the same application but then another window. *Alt+Tab* fixes this issue.
- [Rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle)
  - This makes the Window management work better with hotkeys and mouse dragging over multiple windows and more configuration. A must have for having multiple windows,
    or just a better replacement then what MacOS provides now a day. I am also not happy with the new option menu to close applications as well. Just to have it different? It worked good before...
    Now I need to click twice to close an application and on a submenu to boot.
- [LinearMouse](https://github.com/linearmouse/linearmouse)
  - LinearMouse is a requirement, one of the things is that the scrolldirection is for the whole Mac, not per device or touchpad/external mouse. So when plugging in a new mouse the scrollwheel is inverted. Super annoying!
    And it comes with some nice other perks as well, custom keybinds for scrolling horizontal that wasn't available before with the regular Mac software with an external mouse.
- [Warp](https://warp.dev)
  - This is a way better replacement then the default terminal included in MacOS, but to be fair I also tried out iTerm2, but I wasn't really a fan of it.
    It just makes more sense, has autocomplete out of the box and more, yes others have it as well. 
    But the keybindings and all other things can be changed in the settings and that's what makes me like Warp. But I am still open to other suggestions, as this is not open Source Software as far as I know.
