import Button from "../../components/Button.astro";
import FlexCenter from "../../components/FlexCenter.astro";

It all started when my coworkers made scripts that only worked for Mac. After that I had to switch. Windows was not an option anymore.

Looking back I say I like the hardware of the Mac way more then the Windows machines we used to get. Long battery life, good screen, good speakers, etc.
Nothing to complain about. 

But working with the software has some desires and quirks that made me itchy. So I started looking for solutions for myself.

Quickly I found that other people on the internet are exactly in the same boat.
