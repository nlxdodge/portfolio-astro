import Button from "../../components/Button.astro";
import FlexCenter from "../../components/FlexCenter.astro";

It started out as just helping a friend in need, he made a basic website that people could browse and buy stuff of off. 
He used some Google forms so people can commision things that he makes. Prolem is, he is only used to basic HTML and CSS. Not even JavaScript.

That is making this a very hard case, right? Because without JavaScript. How would you make templating? Lets say you make a single footer. 
You then have to copy paste it over to every other page that you have. That's way too much work, and he shouldn't be doing that in the year 2025.

I tried to look into some static site generators that exist that are easy to use like Astro (but I am saying this from a developers perspective, not a user). 
So that's also hard to judge. Because we know coding, he doesn't. 

I also saw a tool which looks like a CMS system, but runs just like Word on your computer. If you make any changes it will update the underlying files.
And you can easily deploy that to your website. This looks promesing!
