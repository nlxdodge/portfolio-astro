Using something else then Docker, is there even something else just as good? I get the question a lot on my work. Because lots of developers are acustomed to having the Docker GUI instead of using the CLI interface.
When you don't use the GUI and you need to upgrade to a version prior to version `3.6.0`? That means you have to pay for a fee if your company is to big. Most of the time that should not be an issue, and the company will pay.

But what if you only used the GUI for some simple turning on/off and creating some basic images and checking their logs/state? Then Docker GUI has a lot of functionality that you aren't even using. So I started looking for some alternatives some time ago, but never bothered to try it out.

So on that topic, have you ever heard of Podman and Buildah? Well I did not before I started searching. So for now I started to look into how it all works under the hood and while looking for GUI tools I found a new project that just started a couple months ago. [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/) is a GUI for podman that does a lot of things for you, just need to run simple containers? Podman Desktop has you covered.

But it is missing some things that I use all the time, even at work. That feature is composing containers (normally with docker-compose, but that is according to a spec [Compose Specification](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/master/spec.md)).

For now people wrote a Python library called [Podman Compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose) to do this, but the official implementation is still in the backlog for Podman Desktop. So don't expect it anytime soon.

For now I run the build every time again with:

```bash
podman build -t "name" .
podman run -p 3000:3000 name
```
