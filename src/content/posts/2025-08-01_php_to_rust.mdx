I want to get more experience into making things in Rust, and the best thing is to just start building something. 
My KeyDungeon project is already pretty old, and long due for some upgrades. So lets start shall we?

## Tech stack
The plan is to run Rust in a small container and possibly even on my own Raspberry Pi that's already in the closet as a test to see how good or bad it would run.
But for longer periods it's better to just get a VM somewhere in a cloud to have some redundancy.

So I need: 
- A Docker/Kubernetes environment to run the Rust Application (or just a native VM where I can manually install Rust on).
- An HTTP server to serve the Vue front-end Application (Like Apache or NGINX or any Cloud that does the same).
- An e-mail server to send e-mails for sign-up (or make some different way of users logging in, like a passkey).

## What frameworks to pick?

For Rust there are already a lot of frameworks to pick from, think about Axum, Actix Web, Rocket and many more. 
I will just stick with the default recommendation as the original KeyDungeon API is not to complicated and I want to have a somewhat different learning curve.
So I will pick Axum specifically for this reason. Also because Actix Web and Rocket both use the same annotation system as Spring to define endpoints.

For the front-end I am already acustomed to Vue, and that's still my go to for small applications.
