Some of my friends already know that I secretly always wanted to go to Japan, but without speaking or actually having learned any words of the language it's going to be quite the task.
So I started learning Japanese on Duolingo to see how far I can get.

I started out with simple words like `mizu` meaning water and `gohen`
