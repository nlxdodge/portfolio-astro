When I started doing Java I had didn't really like the extra bulk and readability of XML, so for that reason only I choose to use Gradle for my first few projects that I created for my studies.
But low and behold I now get thrown in the working society and found out that all the companies I have worked for so far all use Maven.

"I had to switch..."

So thus begun my quest to learn Maven again (after having used it a couple of times when we had to do projects together).
For example, the Discord bot that I wrote in Java has some dependencies that it needs, which in Gradle would be like this.

## Gradle configuration

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'application'
}

group 'nl.nlxdodge.cate'
version '1.0-SNAPSHOT'

repositories {
    jcenter()
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.google.guava:guava:29.0-jre'
    implementation 'org.glassfish:javax.json:1.1.4'
    implementation 'com.discord4j:discord4j-core:3.1.0'
    implementation 'net.sourceforge.htmlunit:htmlunit:2.43.0'
    implementation 'org.apache.commons:commons-lang3:3.11'

    testImplementation 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api:5.7.0'
    testRuntimeOnly 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine:1.7.0'
}

application {
    mainClassName = 'aq3d.bot.AQ3DBot'
}

test {
    useJUnitPlatform()
}
```

Now when compairing this to the maven variant you would get something like this.
(I tried my best to convert it to a maven variant of course).

## Maven configuration

```xml
    <project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
    http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">

      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
      <groupId>com.javatpoint.application1</groupId>
      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>
      <version>1</version>

    </project>
```
