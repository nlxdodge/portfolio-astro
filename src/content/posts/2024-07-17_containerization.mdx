When I started out with my first Ubuntu server I manually installed everything that I needed. 
Postgres, Plex, some game servers like Minecraft and Factorio and many more.

But eventually I found out that I have a hard time making small improvements to existing applications. 
For Plex I wanted to auto update it, so I got a random update script from GitHub. Of course this was going to break, and it did after a while.
It was also hard to find the update file because I put it all over the place. And not in my user space.

Eventually I wanted to move everything to some sort of CI/CD setup. So I started to migrate away everything to containers.

-	Portainer (to see and debug containers)
-	Traefik (to manage external endpoints and add SSL certificates for those endpoints)
-	Jellyfin (instead of Plex to display media)
-	Rtorrent (to download the torrents)
-	Flood (torrent UI to manage them online)
-	Gluetun (VPN networking container)
- Prowlerr (indexer for Radarr and Sonarr)
- Radarr (searches for movies)
- Sonarr (searches for series)
- Jellyseer (people can request for movies or series through Radarr and Sonarr)
- Obsidian (for taking notes instead of Google Keep as it becomes unmanageable)
- KeepassXC (passwordmanger)?
- Samba (cloud storage TODO)?
- Game servers
  - Minecraft
  - Factorio
