## Contents

The year 2023, I started of with the Rust programming language. Why did I pick Rust? 
I wanted to challenge myself again this year but with a somewhat more lower level programming language, but still with some handholding where you can just jump into. 
Rust was the perfect example for this if I can speak for myself. 

There are a couple of main things you when switching from Java to Rust, for example farbadge collection if a whole different ideolegy now.
For example, in Java garbadge collection is being done for you, no thinking about it. 
But in Rust there is a nifty system for allocating memory for you in some sense.
See bellow example, this is a simple hello world program in Rust. 

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut variable = "123";
    println!("Hello World: {}", variable);
}
```

If you have [Clippy](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/clippy/usage.html) installed and run it with `cargo clippy` you will already get a warning saying that variable is never changed and that the `mut` (mutable tag) is not required. 
But there are more awesome tools to make the development experience a really good one. Want to format your code? The [Rust Code formatter](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) or in the terminal better known as `cargo fmt` is very usefull for this.
No need to setup configuration for every project, you get it for free out of the box. This is a breath of fresh air when comming from Java or JavaScript for that matter.

## TIL (Today I learned)

### Day 1

I alreayd got some experience in Advent of Code 2015 by practicing some of the days from that year, but needless to say I still need to learn a lot.

The borrow and owner system is still kind of ali√´n to me, but I am starting to get the hang of it. You can better read what the compiler says, because most of the time that fixes the issue that I have.

I also followed a video to setup VSCode *Error Lens* which shows what lines gives the error in VSCode for easy debugging. I am also using the Devcontainers extension together with Podman Desktop to run Rust, so you can easily launch the code yourself if you open the `2023 - rust` folder.

Also HashMaps exist! I thought that it didn't but you need to import it with `use std::collections::HashMap;` same as getting a substring with `use substring::Substring;` but for this you need to install a new crate with Cargo called `substring` with `cargo add substring`. It's as easy as that.

And I really üòç the `println!` macro (*yes it's called a macro*), an example that I use almost every day:

```rust
println!("Day 1 ‚≠ê1Ô∏è‚É£  result: {}", star1);
```

Where `star1` can be used within the curly brackets like so: `{star1}` or after the fact, like in the example above.

Together with parsing numbers wich makes it easy as well, with `"32".parse::<i32>().unwrap()` (unless the string is not a number because I am not gracefully handling it at the moment).
With these numbers I can already do some range parsing as well.

I forgot which language it was, but I think Python uses a bit of the same syntax almost. Where you can type something like `0..your_string.len()` in a for-loop and it will get a number iterator.

### Day 2

First time using a Regex in Rust, by default there is no implementation so going with the `regex` üì¶. I also found out it is more limited then the one selected by default on [Regex101](https://regex101.com/) the hard way. So I had to redo some of the code eventually.

### Day 3

Traits, traits and more traits. Comming from Java I wanted an equals (*eq in rust*) function. Seems like the `#[derive(PartialEq)]` does the job for me. So I then can use the contains function in an iterator.
But also the Debug trait is really handy to have, now I can just `println!("{:?}", struct)` and it will print the struct like magic. No custom `to_string()` method required!

And casting is also super easy just do `iter_y as i32` and most of the time it just works ü™Ñ like magic.

And lastly the enumarator with `for (index, line) in lines.iter().enumerate() {` to get a free index with your iterator.

### Day 4

`"Hello World!".split_once(" ")` is really nice to use, as you can now do `.unwrap().0` and always get the first result. Instead of doing `"Hello World!".split(" ").nth(0).unwrap()`.
I also dabbled a bit in using `.is_numeric()` and more accendants.

Also to use HashMaps you need a special import, because it's not enabled by default. To use a HashMap insert `use std::collections::HashMap;` somewhere at the top.

And I wasn't done with the ranges, I found out that using an equals operator before the second number makes it inclusive, like so: `0..=10`;

### Day 5

For day five I did some searching for seeing how I can implement time into the project. With the chrono create it seemed easy enough. So doing `chrono::offset::Local::now()` to get the local datetime so I can print it to the console. I might later write something to compair both and see how long it took to run in seconds etc.

Today was also the day I found out about dereferencing, maybe a bit late but when you have a reference to a i32 variable you can do `*variable` to derefence the variable (from &i32 -> i32), this makes the code a bit cleaner as well but I need to read up on what it's exactly doing. As I am not 100% convined that It will make a copy but just go to the original reference again.
Also this doesn't work for every struct/object as well. So use it sparingly.

This was also the first day where I had to use i64 because the number kept growing to much that it would overflow the i32.

### Day 6

Ah the famed day six, I have a love hate relationship with this one. Here part two required 2 minutes to run on my laptop and 1 minute on my desktop at home. But in hindsight I had to program it differently still, then what I currently have made.

For example I tried to use multithreading with the Rayon crate using `use rayon::prelude::*;`. So actually use multiple cores. But before that I had to optimize the memory management of the application because it kept flowing over 16GB each time. The current implementation doesn't go over 1.5GB in the container where I run Rust in. Apart from that I learned that the `.iter()` handles data per stream keeping the memory usage low (instead of multiple for-loops which is hard to read anyways).

### Day 7

Day seven part one was a lot of fun to make, especially the different rules seeing regular Poker. On this day I learned how the sorting works in Rust and how to make a custom sorting function.

```rust
ranked_hands.sort_by(|a, b| match a.rank.cmp(&b.rank) {
        Ordering::Greater => Ordering::Greater,
        Ordering::Less => Ordering::Less,
        Ordering::Equal => {
            for index in 0..=4 {
                return match card_strength(a.cards.chars().nth(index).unwrap(), joker)
                    .cmp(&card_strength(b.cards.chars().nth(index).unwrap(), joker))
                {
                    Ordering::Greater => Ordering::Greater,
                    Ordering::Less => Ordering::Less,
                    Ordering::Equal => continue,
                };
            }
            Ordering::Equal
        }
    });
```

We where supposed to rankt the cards by their match (5 of a kind is better then 4 of a kind) and if two hands have the same, then we check charachter per character to see what is the highest one.

### Day 8

Day eight on the other hand was a lot easier again, although I did have to look up [LCM (Least Common Multiple)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple) and [GCD (greatest common divisor)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) because I don't really have a good Math background.

### Day 9

I wanted to use pop on an array to remove the first item, I search and found the `VecDeque` which is basically a `Vec` but with some of the Queue functions.
Also for part 2 it was really easy I only had to get the first item and actually do the calculation instead of doing a sum.

### Day 10

Day 10 was kind of weird to do but I had some time issues and never got around it. This is the day where I got stuck because I was overthinking a lot.

Still working on part 2 though.

### Day 11

I am finally taking a deeper dive in the world of modules, right now I have been copy pasting the whole code from the `main.rs` file to the appropriate file, like `aoc10.rs` each time. But this is becomming bothersome now.

I found out that using mod works when running from the main.rs file. So using `use aoc11;` make my life easy so I can just call the run method on each day instead.
