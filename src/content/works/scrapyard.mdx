Scrapyard is my first ever Minecraft mod that is basically a bunch of ideas gathered together into one mod.
Right now it's still in production as I am trying to learn the new Fabric API as that works So much better than Forge.
Check the link for my up to date repository.

The main reason for getting with building my mod again, is that we are actively using java again in our classes. And I wanted to understand Gradle better.

My next step would be to try out Kotlin. But let's begin with the baby steps.

Right now my written code includes:

- Balloon Block
- Glass Sword
- Anti-Silverfish Spray
- Scrap
- Scrap Block

What I am still planning to build, or what I am working on at the moment:

- King Ring
- Glowstone Goggles
- Potion Flask
- Hand Saw
- Obsidian boat
- Bamboo Spear
- Gradma Totem
- Calvorite Ore
- C-Ball
- Void Generator
- Monolith world generation

And some other people already re-created a Recycler as a mod, so I am still thinking of another name.
