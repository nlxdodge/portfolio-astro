I was scared that my server was going to give way, and it kind of happend. The BIOS of my server basically got fried. I had to reflash it again.
But my motherboard didn't have a flash via USB option because it was to old.

I eventually bought another motherboard and fixed the issue, now it's running fine again.
But it got me thinking, what if the boot drive was broken instead this time.
I would have to re-configure my whole machine again, everything would be gone which is not the primairy storage (as that is not being backed-up).

So with this in mind I wanted to do it simple, just a couple docker-compose files to get everything back up and running again.

So I started with the VPN. What about it? I wanted to download things over this in the first place, but never got to it. And always payed for it. So now was the time.
I got my WindScribe configuration and a Gluetun container and got to work. And it was pretty easy to setup as well.
Same for Portainer, Flood, Transmission, Radarr, Sonarr, Jellyfin, Jellyseerr, etc.

But now for the special part, I wanted to have SSL and custom sub domains leading to my server.
So I started with Traefik and got letsencrypt setup on my own domain, so now you can access is securely from the web.

I got scrutiny setup for checking the SMART status of my solid state and hard drives.

Made my minecraft Bedrock server fully automated.

Then as a final touch I got Watchtower to automatically upgrade my containers every week, so I would have to do it less often by hand.

So check it out, the code for it is all on GitHub. But I still need to get the manually configured applications to a settings file when I am done.
