import Button from "../../components/Button.astro";
import FlexCenter from "../../components/FlexCenter.astro";

I was scared that my server was going to give way, and it kind of happend. The BIOS of my server basically got fried. I had to reflash it again.
But my motherboard didn't have a flash via USB option because it was to old.

I eventually bought another motherboard and fixed the issue, now it's running fine again.
But it got me thinking, what if the harddrive was broken instead this time.
I would have to re configure my whole machine again, everything would be gone which is not the primairy storage (as that is not being backed-up).

So with this in mind I wanted to do it simple, just a couple docker-compose files to get everything back up and running again.

So I started with the VPN. What about it? I wanted to download things over this in the first place, but never got to it. So now was the time.
I got my WindScribe and a Gluetun container and got to work. And it was pretty easy as well.
Same for Portainer, Flood, Rtorrent, Jellyfin etc.

But now for the special part, I wanted to have SSL and custom sub domains leading to my server.
